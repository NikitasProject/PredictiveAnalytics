# PredictiveAnalytics
This project aims to predict the tip amount that a customer is likely to leave at a restaurant using predictive analytics on Microsoft Excel. The data used in this project is a sample dataset of restaurant bills and tips.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow the instructions below.

## Prerequisites
1. Microsoft Excel
2. Basic knowledge of Excel functions and formulas

## Running the Model
1. Open the "restaurant_tips_prediction.xlsx" file in Microsoft Excel.
2. Ensure that the "Data" sheet is selected.
3. Enter the restaurant bill details in the "Bill Amount" and "Total Items" columns.
4. The predicted tip amount will be displayed in the "Predicted Tip Amount" column.

## Methodology
The predictive model in this project is based on linear regression. The model was trained on a sample dataset of restaurant bills and tips using Excel's built-in regression analysis tool. The model takes into account the bill amount and the number of items ordered to predict the tip amount.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a sample dataset of restaurant bills and tips. The dataset contains the following columns:
1. Bill Amount: The total bill amount.
2. Total Items: The total number of items ordered.
3. Tip Amount: The tip amount left by the customer.
